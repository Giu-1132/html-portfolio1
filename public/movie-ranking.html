    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Portrait of a lady on fire</h3>
<p>This movie is amazing, the romance is really subtle but heartbreaking and visually is very fascinating.</p>
<h3>Inside out</h3>
<p>One of the best animated movies of all time. It's good for children but even as an adult I've enjoyed it so much! The part talking about the end of childhood also made me cry.</p>
<h3>The Imitation Game</h3>
<p>I love biographies and this was it's really beautiful.</p>
